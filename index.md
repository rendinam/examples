## Selected software developed by Matt Rendina
### Physics instrumentation
- [Instrumentation support library (C)](https://github.com/rendinam/BeamInstSupport) common to several beam instrument types.
- [Communications code generation tool (Python)](https://github.com/rendinam/BeamInstParser) used to produce synchronized data structures and C sources for communications methods used to pass command and payload data between control system server code and instrument software.
- [Embedded instrument software and instrument-specific server code (C)](https://github.com/rendinam/CBPM-TSHARC) for beam position monitors (BPMs) based on TigerSHARC embedded processors.
- [Instrumentation server code (C)](https://github.com/rendinam/CBIC) for the primary instrumentation console application.
- [Proof of concept Python redesign of the above system components (Python)](https://github.com/rendinam/CBPM) meant to simplify application development and take advantage of more advanced language features like exception handling.
- [Multi-language data file I/O library (C, Fortran, MATLAB)](https://github.com/rendinam/cbpmfio) for reading measurement data into C, Fortran, and MATLAB applications.

### Miscellaneous
- [Package usage metrics (Python/pandas)](https://github.com/Astroconda/conmets)
- [CI infrastructure support library for Jenkins (Groovy)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jenkins_shared_ci_utils)
- [Automated package build and publication system for Jenkins (Groovy)](https://github.com/Astroconda/build_control)
