## Selected software developed by Matt Rendina
### Physics instrumentation
- [Instrumentation support library](https://github.com/rendinam/BeamInstSupport) common to several beam instrument types.
- [Communications code generation tool](https://github.com/rendinam/BeamInstParser) used to produce synchronized data structures and communications methods for passing command and payload data between control system server code and instrument software.
- [Embedded instrument software and instrument-specific server code](https://github.com/rendinam/CBPM-TSHARC) for beam position monitors (BPMs) based on TigerSHARC embedded processors.
- [Instrumentation server code](https://github.com/rendinam/CBIC) for the primary instrumentation console application.
- [Proof of concept Python rededesign of the above system components](https://github.com/rendinam/CBPM) Meant to simplify development and take advantage of more advanced language features like exception handling.
- [Multi-language data file I/O library](https://github.com/rendinam/cbpmfio) for reading measurement data into C, Fortran, and MATLAB applications.
